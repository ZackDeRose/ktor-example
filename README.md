## Running in Development

To start a watch mode on the frontend application, run `nx serve todo` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For the frontend application to work properly, you'll also need to start an instance of the backend application. To do so, run `nx serve api` in a second terminal. This will start the `api` application at http://localhost:3000. (NOTE: currently the api application is not configured to reload on changes.)

The frontend project is configured to proxy all api requests to a server running on port 3000 (this is configured in `apps/todo/proxy.conf.json`). This way, the frontend and backend application will communicate with each other correctly using the `nx serve todo` and `nx serve api` commands.

## Understand this workspace
